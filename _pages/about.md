<div style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word; hyphens: auto;" markdown="1">

I was born in February 1999 in Shanghai, China. I obtained my B.Eng. degree from the [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Electronic_Science_and_Technology_of_China){:target="_blank"} (Project 985, U.S. News Global Rank #137) in 2021 and my M.Sc.(Eng.) degree from [Tongji University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongji_University){:target="_blank"} (Project 985, U.S. News Global Rank #124) in 2024. I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at [Urban Mobility Institute](http://umi.tongji.edu.cn/){:target="_blank"}, Tongji University.

I have been supervised by [Professor Chi Xie](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=LQ3KKYQAAAAJ&view_op=list_works){:target="_blank"} at Transport and Energy Systems Laboratory (TESLA) [[📍Location](https://www.google.com/maps/place/4801+Caoan+Hwy,+Jia+Ding+Qu,+Shang+Hai+Shi,+China,+201804/@31.2810611,121.2100163,19z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x35b25cd3667ad407:0xa0105b5da462cc70!8m2!3d31.28106!4d121.21066!16s%2Fg%2F11r8dwp7vp?hl=en&entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MTAyOS4xIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D){:target="_blank"}] since August 2024, with a primary research interest in network modeling and optimization. I have completed a <em>pre-dissertation research</em> on subsidy reallocation in containerized freight transportation networks.

My Ph.D. dissertation focuses on travel demand management (TDM) in dynamic equilibrium traffic networks. A key contribution of my work is the development of an analytical dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) model that is computationally tractable for large-scale networks and accommodates multimodal transportation (e.g., solo driving, e-hailing, carpooling, public transit, and combined modes). Based on this equilibrium model, I analyze and solve a class of TDM strategy (e.g., congestion pricing, tradable mobility credit, and booking cum rationing) optimization problems with specific mathematical structures.
