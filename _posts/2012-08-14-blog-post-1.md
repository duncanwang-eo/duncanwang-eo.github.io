It’s finally time to say goodbye to You Yuan, the place I’ve called home since I first stepped into Tongji University’s Jiading Campus back in September 2021.

I still remember the day I moved into Room 102 in Building 18, a small north facing double room on the first floor. It was cramped, to say the least. The window opened right toward Changji East Road, where the sound of trucks rumbling by was a constant companion. A balcony on the second floor blocked most of the sunlight, leaving the room dim even on bright days. Buildings 16 to 18 were connected, and we shared a common bathhouse located on the first floor of Building 17. Those evening rush hours, waiting in line for a shower, became part of our daily routine.

But it was in this little space that some of my most unforgettable memories were made.

On April 3, 2022, right after I submitted my first journal paper for peer review, I was about to celebrate when I noticed everyone carrying lunchboxes back to their dorms. Before I knew it, we were locked down, a two month long quarantine that began without warning. During those days, we weren't allowed to leave our suites except for short, scheduled "outdoor breaks." Research came to a standstill, but life didn't. I spent my time reading papers, strumming my guitar, and enjoying a strange sense of peace. In that tiny room, life felt simple and unburdened.

After the lockdown was lifted, life slowly returned to normal. I even participated in two campus singing competitions. I remember practicing in the first floor courtyard of Building 18, my voice echoing slightly in the open space. Looking back, those moments of music and connection remain some of my most cherished memories from You Yuan.

After I started my Ph.D., I managed to secure a spot through the online dorm selection system in Building 12, a south facing triple room on the fifth floor. It was much more spacious and had much better natural light. It also had its own private bathroom, a major upgrade. The only downside was the lack of an elevator; carrying heavy items up to the fifth floor was always a small challenge. My daily commute to the lab in the Sci & Tech Park near the South Gate meant biking back and forth. This became necessary after a traffic incident on campus led to stricter vehicle access rules; even though I lived on campus, I had to park my car further away and walk a significant distance. On cold winter mornings or during downpours, the commute wasn't always easy.

This October, when the annual dorm adjustment window opened for doctoral students, I decided it was time for a change. I moved to Shu Xiang Ju, a modern residential complex originally built in 2016. Our specific building, however, is part of a newer section completed in 2024. It's the first row of buildings facing the South Building of Sci & Tech Park Zone B, where my lab is located. I was lucky enough to select a mid floor master bedroom in a three bedroom apartment, originally a living room connected to a balcony, now converted into the largest room in the unit. And the best part? I have the room all to myself.

For just ¥2,300 a year, I now enjoy about 16 square meters of personal space. The underground parking garage is shared with my lab building, so I only pay an additional ¥2,000 annually to park. From my door, it's just a two or three minute walk to the lab. No more biking in the rain or cold. Life has become incredibly comfortable.

You Yuan was more than just a dorm; it was where I grew, struggled, laughed, and dreamed. I'll always cherish the memories made there, both challenging and joyful. But as one chapter ends, another begins. Here's to new beginnings, and to the cozy room in Shu Xiang Ju that I now call home.

Farewell, You Yuan. Thank you for everything.
