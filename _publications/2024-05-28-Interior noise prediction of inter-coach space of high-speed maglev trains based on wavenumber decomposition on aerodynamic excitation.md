## Abstract
Current research on noise and vibration control of high-speed maglev trains pays more attention to far-ﬁeld noise, while the level of interior noise has a direct impact on the ride comfort and should be placed equal weight on. In this paper, intercoach space, one of the main pressure ﬂuctuation sources of a speciﬁc type of high-speed maglev train with a design speed of 600 km·h<sup>-1</sup>, is taken as the research object. The turbulent and acoustic components of wall pressure ﬂuctuations (WPF) are separated based on a wavenumber-frequency analysis approach, and then each component is applied as different forms of source input to the vibroacoustic model, namely, ﬁnite element method-boundary element method (FEM-BEM) and statistical energy analysis (SEA) for low- and high-frequency ranges respectively, to investigate the contribution of both components to interior acoustic cavity in all frequency range. It can be seen quantitatively from the results that the amplitude of turbulent component is generally much higher than that of the acoustic one, but it can be vice versa when it comes to the interior response. The conclusion drawn in this paper are able to provide guidance for future researches on more targeted interior noise control of high-speed maglev trains.
